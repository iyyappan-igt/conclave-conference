One has to add a Ophthall red glow enhancer to it and then the magic unfolds. Guys u will forget the brands!!! Why spend 3-4 times the amount on a brand when u can have all of it in such an affordable price, nor there will be a need to buy second hand branded microscopes. Vocal for Local !!! Go for it, u can thank me later…",

I was skeptical whether Omniglo will be of much help to me or not. But still, I bought it. After using it, I am happy I bought it. It makes a lot of difference. Red reflex with it is really good and makes your life much easier. Makes you more comfortable in those borderline cases where you are not whether to stain with trypan blue or not. This is a really nice product. I have just bought it. I hope it doesn't give any problems in the long run and after-sales service is equally good. Dr. Nishank Mittal New Delhi.",

In all my previous deals after completion always there was a loosing feel & always their was a doubt 'did I get the best deel'. I always felt as a group we can do things in a much better way than as individual. Omniglow is an asset & a beautiful accessory. I had zeis visu 140. I feel it's rejuvenated & I am enjoying my surgeries. Installation was quick & hassle-free. The enhanced red glow is mesmerizing & view is crystal clear. I also have a suggestion to omniglow team. Please add a foot control. It will be very useful. Thanks to team Ophthall for the excellent support. Dr. Arun Adkoli, Bangalore.",
